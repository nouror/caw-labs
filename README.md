### 4.3 What does Git tell you about the new folder and the moved files? 

This git status output shows the changes in my repository:

  README.md is modified but not staged for commit means i made changes to this file.
  
  Lab1/ is a new folder that Git doesn't track yet

Git indicates that there are modified and untracked files and folder in the project but no changes are currently staged for commit.

What i got after git status:
$ git status

On branch master

Changes not staged for commit:

  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)

  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README.md

Untracked files:

  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
  
        Lab1/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
