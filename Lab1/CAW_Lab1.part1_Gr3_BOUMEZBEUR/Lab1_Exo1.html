    <h2 id="point1">Brief History</h2>
        <p><strong>The Seizure of the Land and the Displacement of People :</strong>
            Palestine was never <b>a land without a people,</b>
            it was a homeland for its Arab people who had lived on it for decades.
            The Zionist project with <em>colonial support</em> came to expel them from their land. 
            In the Nakba of 1948, Zionist militias destroyed over 500 villages
            and expelled more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homes by force of arms. 
            This was a systematic ethnic cleansing operation
            that turned the majority of the Palestinian people into refugees scattered around the world, 
            deprived of their right to return to their <b>stolen lands and homes.</b></p>

        <p><strong>Continuous Occupation :</strong>
            Israel was not content with seizing 78% of the land of Palestine in 1948,
            it occupied the remaining Palestinian lands in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem 
            in the 1967 aggression. 
            Since then, the Palestinian people have lived under the yoke of a 
            racist and settler-colonial occupation that <b>steals their land</b> then
            builds illegal settlements on it, demolishes their homes, 
            arrests their children and imposes a suffocating siege on Gaza, 
            turning it into <em>the world's largest open-air prison.</em> 
            The Palestinian resistance to this occupation is a 
            legitimate right guaranteed by all international conventions.</p>

       <p><strong>Genocide in Gaza and the Continuation of Resistance :</strong>
            What is happening in Gaza today is a genocide by all international standards:
            the bombing of cities, the slaughter of children, 
            deliberate starvation, and forced displacement. 
            These crimes are merely a new chapter in <b>the Zionist project</b> 
            that seeks to end the entire Palestinian existence. 
            However, the will of the Palestinian people proves that 
            <em>justice will prevail,</em> and that the resistance against the occupation will continue until 
            <b>liberation.</b></p>
